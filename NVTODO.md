Equational Reasoning 
--------------------

- HERE 
Do more careful instantiation of axioms: 
Now for each term I create a fresh variable to curry the refinements. 
Create one and reuse it. 



Easy: 
  - Simplify sufficient axioms 

Other: 
  - Create Haskell expression that is equivalent to the sufficient axioms and 
      - replace the call to auto
      - give it to the user 

Efficiency: 
  - reuse all the SMT/logic info



- DONE  
Reduce terms because for example, term append N N appears. 
Check uniqueness of terms
