Equational Reasoning 
--------------------

Easy: 
  - Pass info from static CG environment. Now I move all required info to dynamic env
  - Simplify sufficient axioms 
  - Print the SMT files in the .liquid

Other: 
  - Create Haskell expression that is equivalent to the sufficient axioms and 
      - replace the call to auto
      - give it to the user 

Efficiency: 
  - reuse all the SMT/logic info
